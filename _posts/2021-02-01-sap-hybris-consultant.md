## Create AP theme
Greenfield development of SAP Hybris Commerce Cloud solution, part of the core development team for an international B2B-Webshop
* Implementation of user stories for backend
* Design and Implementation of REST-APIs
* Improving code quality (Refactorings, Test-coverage, ...)
* Technology-stack: Hybris Platform (Java, Spring), RabbitMq, Spartacus Frontend

## Tech
Now that I have a github page, I need to know ruby and jekyll.  
And, html, js, css or so?  


## Duration
It did not take long to change the existing theme.  
I made it by modifying the ["tale"](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) theme.
